## Transforming special collections materials into ornithological data

In 2016, the Iowa State University Library was awarded a CLIR grant to
digitize several ornithological collections that were part of our special
collections to create avIAn: Avian Archive of Iowa Online. What made this
project unique was that in addition to creating a fairly traditional digital
collection, we would also build a data set out of rare bird sighting
documentation, transforming an inaccessible paper archive into online data
for anyone to use. This talk will give an overview of how a team of library
staff without ornithological expertise tackled the task of building a public
data set.
